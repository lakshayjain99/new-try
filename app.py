I literally cried in the office washroom that day. I decided to prepare something to feel sorry for my actions and started working on this. \nI can go on and on but I will not talk much now. \n\nIn the end, I just want to wish you lots and lots of happiness in your life and I really hope that all your wishes come true and I request and wish you unblock me from calling, whatsapp and follow each other over Instagram, so that harr saal 15 September ko call toh kar pau main.\n\nI really hope you will come to my wedding in 2026(baniya kids and their wedding obsession) and abhi ke tarah mana nahi karoge and you will invite me to yours as well.\n\nLots of love and happiness to you and your loved ones.\n\n\n\nKeep Smiling Always and forever, you are cute and looks way cuter when you smile.\n\nThanks & Regards\nLakshay".format(user_feedback)
